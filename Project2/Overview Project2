CS-172-02 Project 2

* * * Fill In Your Name * * *

Overview

The goal for this project is to systematically develop a TIC-TAC-TOE application; the process is 

similar to developing Connect-4 and Gomoku which are more challenging. Record your answers as you 

go through following stages of development. Each stage is worth an equal portion of the grade.

Turn in the following items in an email to schaeffer@lclark.edu

This document with your answers

A Java file with your code

1. Describe a simple test plan to determine your application's functionality.

2. List all primitive types you think you will need and what information they will hold. Later this 

list can change.

3. Describe all actions that will read or write to these primitive types. Each action will correspond 

to code comments in subsequent stages.

4. Describe your move encoding, e.g. typing “11” may correspond to the upper-left corner.

5. Code a test program which displays instructions and then accepts one of 9 board positions but 

rejects all other positions. Copy and paste your code here.

6. Code another test program which defines and displace a game board using a two dimensional 

array. Copy and paste your code here.

7. Extending 6., code game state detection logic, e.g. win, draw, ..., and report results with 

appropriate String displays. Copy and paste your code here.

8. Create a complete game. Test and debug until working. Copy and paste your application's 

output. Take a look at the difference between your final version and your predicted primitive 

types and actions in 2. and 3. above. There typically will be some differences.
